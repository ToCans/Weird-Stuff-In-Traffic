# nuScenes Dataset

The nuScenes dataset is a large-scale, multimodal dataset for autonomous driving, collected by Motional. It contains 1000 diverse driving scenes recorded with 6 cameras, 5 radars, 1 LiDAR, GPS, and IMU sensors, along with 23 object class annotations and rich semantic maps. With detailed sensor calibration and timestamps, it is ideal for tasks like 3D object detection, tracking, prediction, and localization research.

This dataset is intended for use with autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning models.
