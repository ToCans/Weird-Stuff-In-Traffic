##### General Workflow:

-   Clone the repository locally (done in terminal)
    -   `git clone https://github.com/ToCans/Weird-Stuff-In-Traffic.git `
-   Create an issue and add documentation for your specific task (i.e. create frontend) and add tags (example in the "issues" tab)
    -   naming scheme "feature/whatever-you-want-to-call-this"
-   Create a development branch for the task/feature you want to make
    -   naming scheme "feature/whatever-you-want-to-call-this"
-   Check the branch out locally (done in terminal)
    -   `git fetch origin`
    -   `git checkout feature/example-for-reference`
-   Start working locally
-   When you're done with your task you can push your changes to your branch with (done in terminal):
    -   `git add .`
    -   `git commit -m "Whatever you want to name this"`
    -   `git push`
-   When your code is ready to be merged into the main branch, open a pull request in the tab above and set someone to review your work (maybe group leaders?)
